<h1>The best movies of 2023-2024 according to Jacinthe</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of the last 12 months</h2> 
<hr />
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Great work of art! Visually stunning and Villeneuve's version is bringing a new light to the story of the books (not only the first one).</p>
<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>After reading the first 4 books by Frank Herbert, I enjoyed the second movie as much as the first one. The actors are even more amazing and the costume of Lady Jessika is amazing.</p>
<h3>Everything, Everywhere, all at once</h3>
<p>The synopsys of this movie is hard to explain. Anyhow, this was a totally disjuncted movie and I enjoyed watching it for the second time. There was more things to understand after a second viewing.</p>
